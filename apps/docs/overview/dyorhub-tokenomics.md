### ⚙️ Fair Launch via Pump.fun

We chose to launch $DYORHUB on [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun) because it guarantees a **rug-proof, fair, and immutable token distribution**, with no tricks or hidden allocations.

Here’s what this means:

* **No presale**
* **No private allocation**
* **No dev mint**
* **No wallet whitelist**
* **No liquidity rug risk**

### 🔐 Why This Matters

Launching with pump.fun protects users and keeps the playing field level:

* No centralized supply control
* No team wallets selling on your head
* No token rug risk
* Easy on-chain verification

We believe in **doing your own research** — and that starts with a fair launch.
