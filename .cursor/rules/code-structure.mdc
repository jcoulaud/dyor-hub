If you need to run pnpm commands, use this before: "export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && nvm use 23.4.0 &&"

- My nest js backend is in apps/api/src
- My shared types are in packages/types/src (you need to build them if you change/add types by going to packages/types and typing pnpm build)
- My frontend api file proxy that calls my controllers is in apps/web/src/lib/api.ts
- Don't install and use Swagger packages
- Don't generate or run the migrations yourself, I will do it. Let me know when I need to do it
- Don't try to run/build the frontend or backend, I'm doing this myself
